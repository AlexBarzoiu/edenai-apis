    "translatedText": "Artificial intelligence, also known as omniscient and machine intelligence, refers to the wisdom expressed by machines made by humans. Usually artificial intelligence refers to the technology that presents human intelligence through ordinary computer programs. The term also points to research into whether and how such intelligent systems can be realized. At the same time, through advances in medicine, neuroscience, robotics, and statistics, the norm predicts that many human occupations are gradually being replaced by them.",
