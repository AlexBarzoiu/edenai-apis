It is not a distinct species itself, but rather a melanistic variant of leopards and jaguars. The mesmerizing black coat of the panther is a result of a genetic mutation that increases the production of dark pigment, melanin."

Their keen senses, including sharp vision and acute hearing, aid them in locating prey, often stalking their victims from the cover of trees or thick underbrush before launching a precise and powerful attack. The diet of a panther consists mainly of deer, wild boar, and smaller mammals."
