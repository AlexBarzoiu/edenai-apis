Character recognition has long been a essential area for research since years. Recognition of character is a minor work for humans, but to make a computer program that does character recognition is extremely difficult. Hence to make a machine recognize the characters and efficiently determine a pattern has been the primary concern for researchers now days This paper discusses various offline and online Optical Character Recognition Techniques (OCR).\r\nKeywords: OCR, online, offline, online, zoning, euler number.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\nOCR is an approach that provides a full alphanumeric recognition  of  printed  or  handwritten  characters  at electronically by simply scanning them and generating into a form that can be scanned through a scanner and then the recognition engine of the OCR system interpret the images and turn images of handwritten or printed characters into ASCII  data  (machine-readable  characters).Character recognition also popularly referred as optical character recognition (OCR) is a field of research that has immense potential in future where we want to track and locate every piece of information being exchanged. The problem with the hand written text is due to uncertainties such as variation in calligraphy over period of time, similarity in text, variation in styles of writing [3] The character recognition system helps in making the communication between a human and a computer easy.[4] The character recognition is basically classified  into  two  types:  offline  handwritten  text recognition, online handwritten text recognition. Offline means the text written on the plain paper or sheet and then the writing is usually captured optically by a scanner and the completed writing is available as an image. Online means the text written on any digital devices such as tablets using stylus i.e. the two dimensional coordinates of successive points are represented as a function of time and the order of strokes made by the writer are also available.[6]\r\n2. Applications   of   optical   character recognition\r\nThe area of OCR is becoming an integral part of document scanners, and is used in many applications such as postal processing,  script  recognition,  banking,  security  (i.e. passport  authentication)  and  language  identification, document reading, mail sorting, signature verification, writer identification., license plate recognition system, smart card processing system, automatic data entry, bank cheque /DD processing, money counting machine, postal automation, address and zip code recognition etc many organizations are depending  on  OCR  systems  to  eliminate  the  human interactions for better performance and efficiency [2,4,6,7].\r\n3. Potential problem areas for OCR\r\n1. The same characters differ in sizes, shapes and styles from person to person and even from time to time with the same person. The source of confusion is the high level of abstraction: there are thousands styles of type in common use plus variations in calligraphy and a character recognition program must recognize most of these.\r\n2. Like any image, visual characters are subject to spoilage due to noise. Some images containing characters are already blurred or not clear which makes them difficult to process. Noise consists of random changes to a pattern, particularly near the edges. A character with much noise may be interpreted as a completely different character by a computer program.\r\n3. There  are  no  hard-and-fast  rules  that  define  the appearance of a visual character. Hence rules need to be heuristically deduced from the samples.\r\n\r\n4. Phases of OCR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVolume 2 Issue 5, May 2013 www.ijsr.net\r\n\r\n155\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), India Online ISSN: 2319-7064\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Data Acquisition\r\n\r\nMost Important initial phase in OCR is to gather the image from either device sensor like PDA or tablets in case on online  recognition  or  getting  the  images  containing characters directly for offline recognition.\r\n\r\nIn Image acquisition, the recognition system acquires a scanned image as an input image. The image should have a specific format such as JPEG, BMP etc. This image is acquired through a scanner, digital camera or any other suitable  digital  input  device.  Data  samples  for  the experiment have been collected from different individuals [9].\r\n\r\n2. Pre Processing\r\n\r\nThe goal of pre-processing is to simplify the pattern recognition problem without missing any vital information. It reduces the noises and inconsistent data. It enhances the image and prepares it for the next steps [3].\r\n\r\nPreprocessing is the preliminary step which transforms the data into a format that will be more easily and effectively processed. Therefore, the main task in preprocessing the captured data is to decrease the variation that causes a reduction  in  the  recognition  rate  and  increases  the complexities, as for example, preprocessing of the input raw stroke of characters is crucial for the success of efficient character recognition systems. Thus, preprocessing is an essential stage prior to feature extraction since it controls the suitability of the results for the successive stages [2].\r\nPreprocessing  can  be  done  through  various  ways Binarization, Noise reduction, Stroke width normalization, Skew correction, Slant removal, Filtering, Morphological Operations, Noise Modelling, Skew Normalization, Size Normalization,   Contour   Smoothing,   Compression, Thresholding, Thinning etc\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Slant Removal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Normalization of \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018l\u2019 as in [9]\r\n\r\n3. Segmentation\r\n\r\nSegmentation is an integral part of any text based recognition system. It assures efficiency of classification and\r\nrecognition. Accuracy of character recognition heavily depends upon segmentation phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Segmentation [9]\r\n\r\n4. Normalization\r\n\r\nThe results of segmentation process provides isolated characters which are ready to pass through feature extraction stage, thus the isolated characters are reduced to a specific size depending on the methods used. The segmentation process essentially renders the image in the form of m*n matrix. These matrices are then generally normalized by reducing the size and removing the redundant information from the image without losing any important information.\r\n\r\n5. Feature Extraction\r\n\r\nFeature extraction is the process of extracting the relevant features from objects/alphabets to form a feature vectors. These feature vectors is then used by classifiers to recognize the input unit with target output unit. It becomes easier for the classifier to classify between different classes by looking at these features as it allows fairly easy to distinguish.\r\n\r\nFeature extraction is also defined as extracting the raw data the information which is most relevant for classification purposes  in  the  sense  of  minimizing  the  pattern variability.[1]\r\nDue to the nature of handwriting with its high degree of variability and imprecision obtaining these features, is a difficult task. Feature extraction methods are based on 3 types of features:\r\n\r\n\u2022  Statistical\r\n\u2022  Structural\r\n\u2022  Global transformations and moments Statistical Features includes:\r\n1. Zoning\r\n\r\nThe character image is divided into NxM zones. From each zone features are extracted to form the feature vector. The\r\n\r\n\r\nVolume 2 Issue 5, May 2013 www.ijsr.net\r\n\r\n156\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), India Online ISSN: 2319-7064\r\n\r\n\r\ngoal of zoning is to obtain the local characteristics instead of global characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal Transformations-Moments:\r\n\r\nThe Fourier Transform (FT) of the contour of the image is calculated. Since the first n coefficients of the FT can be used in order to reconstruct the contour, then these n coefficients are considered to be a n-dimensional feature vector that represents the character.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: zoning\r\n\r\nAfter dividing the character into different zones you can compare the density or direction features of it and classify each one of them.\r\n\r\n2. Projection Histograms\r\n\r\nThe basic idea behind using projections is that character images, which are 2-D signals, can be represented as 1- D signal. These features, although independent to noise and  deformation,  depend  on  rotation.  Projection histograms count the number of pixels in each column and row of a character image. Projection histograms can separate characters such as \u201cm\u201d and \u201cn\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Contouring\r\n\r\n6 Classification\r\n\r\nThe results Classification is the last stage where we train the neural net using the feature vectors obtained during feature extraction method against the required targets. To optimize the whole recognition process, several combination methods of multilayer perceptron have been devised. E.g.: k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Bayes Classifier, Neural Networks (NN), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc there is no such thing as the \u201cbest classifier\u201d. The use of classifier depends on many factors, such as available training set, number of free parameters etc.\r\n\r\n7. Post Processing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Profiles\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Projection Histogram\r\nThe goal of post processing is the incorporation of context and shape information in all the stages of OCR systems is necessary for meaningful improvements in recognition rates.\r\n\r\n5. Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe profile counts the number of pixels (distance) between the bounding box of the character image and the edge of the character. The profiles describe well the external shapes of characters and allow distinguishing between a great number of letters, such as \u201cp\u201d and \u201cq\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Profiling\r\n\r\n4. Structural features:\r\n\r\nStructural features are based on topological and geometrical properties of the character, such as aspect ratio, cross points, loops, branch points, strokes and their directions, inflection between two points, horizontal curves at top or bottom, etc.\r\n\r\nThe character recognition methods have been introduced and developed over the years. In this paper, I have tried to explain the overview of the whole OCR process and the methods related to it. Many researchers try to hybrid two or more  different  methods  and  compare  the  results  for efficiency but again this will be application specific and parameter specific. OCR has been implemented in various countries for recognizing different languages as well.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] Oivind Due Trier, Anil K.

Character recognition has long been a essential area for research since years. Recognition of character is a minor work for humans, but to make a computer program that does character recognition is extremely difficult. Hence to make a machine recognize the characters and efficiently determine a pattern has been the primary concern for researchers now days This paper discusses various offline and online Optical Character Recognition Techniques (OCR).\r\nKeywords: OCR, online, offline, online, zoning, euler number.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\nOCR is an approach that provides a full alphanumeric recognition  of  printed  or  handwritten  characters  at electronically by simply scanning them and generating into a form that can be scanned through a scanner and then the recognition engine of the OCR system interpret the images and turn images of handwritten or printed characters into ASCII  data  (machine-readable  characters).Character recognition also popularly referred as optical character recognition (OCR) is a field of research that has immense potential in future where we want to track and locate every piece of information being exchanged. The problem with the hand written text is due to uncertainties such as variation in calligraphy over period of time, similarity in text, variation in styles of writing [3] The character recognition system helps in making the communication between a human and a computer easy.[4] The character recognition is basically classified  into  two  types:  offline  handwritten  text recognition, online handwritten text recognition. Offline means the text written on the plain paper or sheet and then the writing is usually captured optically by a scanner and the completed writing is available as an image. Online means the text written on any digital devices such as tablets using stylus i.e. the two dimensional coordinates of successive points are represented as a function of time and the order of strokes made by the writer are also available.[6]\r\n2. Applications   of   optical   character recognition\r\nThe area of OCR is becoming an integral part of document scanners, and is used in many applications such as postal processing,  script  recognition,  banking,  security  (i.e. passport  authentication)  and  language  identification, document reading, mail sorting, signature verification, writer identification., license plate recognition system, smart card processing system, automatic data entry, bank cheque /DD processing, money counting machine, postal automation, address and zip code recognition etc many organizations are depending  on  OCR  systems  to  eliminate  the  human interactions for better performance and efficiency [2,4,6,7].\r\n3. Potential problem areas for OCR\r\n1. The same characters differ in sizes, shapes and styles from person to person and even from time to time with the same person. The source of confusion is the high level of abstraction: there are thousands styles of type in common use plus variations in calligraphy and a character recognition program must recognize most of these.\r\n2. Like any image, visual characters are subject to spoilage due to noise. Some images containing characters are already blurred or not clear which makes them difficult to process. Noise consists of random changes to a pattern, particularly near the edges. A character with much noise may be interpreted as a completely different character by a computer program.\r\n3. There  are  no  hard-and-fast  rules  that  define  the appearance of a visual character. Hence rules need to be heuristically deduced from the samples.\r\n\r\n4. Phases of OCR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVolume 2 Issue 5, May 2013 www.ijsr.net\r\n\r\n155\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), India Online ISSN: 2319-7064\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Data Acquisition\r\n\r\nMost Important initial phase in OCR is to gather the image from either device sensor like PDA or tablets in case on online  recognition  or  getting  the  images  containing characters directly for offline recognition.\r\n\r\nIn Image acquisition, the recognition system acquires a scanned image as an input image. The image should have a specific format such as JPEG, BMP etc. This image is acquired through a scanner, digital camera or any other suitable  digital  input  device.  Data  samples  for  the experiment have been collected from different individuals [9].\r\n\r\n2. Pre Processing\r\n\r\nThe goal of pre-processing is to simplify the pattern recognition problem without missing any vital information. It reduces the noises and inconsistent data. It enhances the image and prepares it for the next steps [3].\r\n\r\nPreprocessing is the preliminary step which transforms the data into a format that will be more easily and effectively processed. Therefore, the main task in preprocessing the captured data is to decrease the variation that causes a reduction  in  the  recognition  rate  and  increases  the complexities, as for example, preprocessing of the input raw stroke of characters is crucial for the success of efficient character recognition systems. Thus, preprocessing is an essential stage prior to feature extraction since it controls the suitability of the results for the successive stages [2].\r\nPreprocessing  can  be  done  through  various  ways Binarization, Noise reduction, Stroke width normalization, Skew correction, Slant removal, Filtering, Morphological Operations, Noise Modelling, Skew Normalization, Size Normalization,   Contour   Smoothing,   Compression, Thresholding, Thinning etc\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Slant Removal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Normalization of \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018l\u2019 as in [9]\r\n\r\n3. Segmentation\r\n\r\nSegmentation is an integral part of any text based recognition system. It assures efficiency of classification and\r\nrecognition. Accuracy of character recognition heavily depends upon segmentation phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Segmentation [9]\r\n\r\n4. Normalization\r\n\r\nThe results of segmentation process provides isolated characters which are ready to pass through feature extraction stage, thus the isolated characters are reduced to a specific size depending on the methods used. The segmentation process essentially renders the image in the form of m*n matrix. These matrices are then generally normalized by reducing the size and removing the redundant information from the image without losing any important information.\r\n\r\n5. Feature Extraction\r\n\r\nFeature extraction is the process of extracting the relevant features from objects/alphabets to form a feature vectors. These feature vectors is then used by classifiers to recognize the input unit with target output unit. It becomes easier for the classifier to classify between different classes by looking at these features as it allows fairly easy to distinguish.\r\n\r\nFeature extraction is also defined as extracting the raw data the information which is most relevant for classification purposes  in  the  sense  of  minimizing  the  pattern variability.[1]\r\nDue to the nature of handwriting with its high degree of variability and imprecision obtaining these features, is a difficult task. Feature extraction methods are based on 3 types of features:\r\n\r\n\u2022  Statistical\r\n\u2022  Structural\r\n\u2022  Global transformations and moments Statistical Features includes:\r\n1. Zoning\r\n\r\nThe character image is divided into NxM zones. From each zone features are extracted to form the feature vector. The\r\n\r\n\r\nVolume 2 Issue 5, May 2013 www.ijsr.net\r\n\r\n156\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), India Online ISSN: 2319-7064\r\n\r\n\r\ngoal of zoning is to obtain the local characteristics instead of global characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal Transformations-Moments:\r\n\r\nThe Fourier Transform (FT) of the contour of the image is calculated. Since the first n coefficients of the FT can be used in order to reconstruct the contour, then these n coefficients are considered to be a n-dimensional feature vector that represents the character.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: zoning\r\n\r\nAfter dividing the character into different zones you can compare the density or direction features of it and classify each one of them.\r\n\r\n2. Projection Histograms\r\n\r\nThe basic idea behind using projections is that character images, which are 2-D signals, can be represented as 1- D signal. These features, although independent to noise and  deformation,  depend  on  rotation.  Projection histograms count the number of pixels in each column and row of a character image. Projection histograms can separate characters such as \u201cm\u201d and \u201cn\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Contouring\r\n\r\n6 Classification\r\n\r\nThe results Classification is the last stage where we train the neural net using the feature vectors obtained during feature extraction method against the required targets. To optimize the whole recognition process, several combination methods of multilayer perceptron have been devised. E.g.: k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Bayes Classifier, Neural Networks (NN), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc there is no such thing as the \u201cbest classifier\u201d. The use of classifier depends on many factors, such as available training set, number of free parameters etc.\r\n\r\n7. Post Processing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Profiles\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Projection Histogram\r\nThe goal of post processing is the incorporation of context and shape information in all the stages of OCR systems is necessary for meaningful improvements in recognition rates.\r\n\r\n5. Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe profile counts the number of pixels (distance) between the bounding box of the character image and the edge of the character. The profiles describe well the external shapes of characters and allow distinguishing between a great number of letters, such as \u201cp\u201d and \u201cq\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Profiling\r\n\r\n4. Structural features:\r\n\r\nStructural features are based on topological and geometrical properties of the character, such as aspect ratio, cross points, loops, branch points, strokes and their directions, inflection between two points, horizontal curves at top or bottom, etc.\r\n\r\nThe character recognition methods have been introduced and developed over the years. In this paper, I have tried to explain the overview of the whole OCR process and the methods related to it. Many researchers try to hybrid two or more  different  methods  and  compare  the  results  for efficiency but again this will be application specific and parameter specific. OCR has been implemented in various countries for recognizing different languages as well.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] Oivind Due Trier, Anil K.
