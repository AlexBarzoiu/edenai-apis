Socrates (/ˈsɒkrətiːz/;[1] Greek: Σωκράτης; c. 470–399 BC) was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as the
    founder of Western philosophy and among the first moral philosophers of the ethical tradition of thought.

Plato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity.

In a seminal work titled "The Worth of Socrates as a Philosopher" (1818), the philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher attacked Xenophon's accounts; his attack was widely accepted.
