  "text": "Artificial intelligence, also known as intelligent weapons and machine intelligence, refers to the wisdom expressed by machines made by humans. Generally, artificial intelligence refers to the technology that presents human intelligence through ordinary computer programs. The term also points to studying whether and how such intelligent systems can be implemented. At the same time, through advances in medicine, neuroscience, robotics, and statistics, the normal prediction is that many occupations of human beings are gradually being replaced by them."
